A few days back on a DL I frequent, someone asked for a better traffic mobile app. The thread piqued my interest, but I really thought it would be a rehash of all the known apps out there.

You see, I commute 25.6 miles to work. Each way. And it’s right through the middle of Seattle traffic. In 2010 Seattle ranked #10 in the nation for the worst congestion. On a good day during commute hours it will take me about 1:15 to get to work. On a bad day it can be more like 1:45. As you can see, I spend a lot of time in the car. *(I’ve also experimented with the Connector, Microsoft’s employee bus service, carpooling, and the Metro bus. There’s a few reasons I choose to still drive, but that’s not important right now).*

There were a few replies to the thread suggesting traffic apps: Google Maps, the Washington DOT app, bla bla bla. The problem is they are all terrible. Horrible. They show you traffic, but they don’t help you make any intelligent decisions about which route to take (I have three routes I can take). And they never seem to be accurate enough. There’s plenty of times I’ve been stopped in traffic while Google maps happily shows the road I am on as yellow (meaning slow, but not stopped).

One app was mentioned that I had not heard of before: [Waze](http://www.waze.com). The idea behind it is pretty brilliant – crowd sourced traffic. They are not the first to do it, but they’ve built a pretty cool app around the concept.

The way it works is simple – start up the app and start driving. Using your phone’s GPS, it starts uploading your position and speed to other users around you. And you get the benefit of other users’ data as well. It magically builds the traffic map based on everyone’s cumulative data.

You can also report incidents, police activity, or unsafe conditions. Other drivers will get alerted on their devices. But Waze turns this into a bit of a game. Since anyone can report an incident, how do you know that it’s accurate? Well, as other users approach the reported location, a little popup shows up. Other users can confirm the incident or indicate it’s not there.

You build up reputation by driving more miles, reporting incidents (do this safely, preferably when not driving – but it’s pretty quick and easy to do so by selecting one or two buttons – no typing needed), starting a group of fellow Wazers, or reporting map inaccuracies. 

It also figures out where you like to go and how you like to get there. Since I can drive any of three routes to get to work, it quickly shows me my three alternatives and estimated travel times for each. I can quickly select the fastest route, using real time data, without having to rely on broadly applied map colors on which to based my decision. In fact, over the last two days using the app, it has saved me about 20 minutes each day. I first opened up another traffic map, selected a route based on my usual criteria, then let Waze calculate the best route. Waze beat me both times.

Another cool feature is that it can provide traffic conditions on streets that aren’t large enough for other apps to cover. For example, the DOT gets its data from sensors embedded in the pavement, but only on streets where it has sensors. Waze can give you information on any street where another user has driven. If there were enough users, you could get up to date traffic information for my very own cul-de-sac.

There seems to be a lot more to the app than what I’ve described. I’ll admit, for now, I still open up another app to confirm Waze’s recommendations. But it’s quickly gaining my trust and confidence every day. It’s available for iPhone, Android, Blackberry and Nokia phones. Check them out at [www.waze.com](http://www.waze.com). 

Drive safe.
