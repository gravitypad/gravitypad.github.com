This is a C#/.Net port of Sosumi by Tyler Hall. Tyler's original PHP project can be found here: [https://github.com/tylerhall/sosumi](https://github.com/tylerhall/sosumi)

nSosumi will allow you to programmatically retrieve your iOS device's current location, send it a message/play a sound, remotely lock or remotely wipe your iOS device. I've tested it with my iPhone 4's and an iPad, all running iOS 4.2.

You can find the source here: [http://code.google.com/p/nsosumi](http://code.google.com/p/nsosumi). I'll be providing more details soon.
