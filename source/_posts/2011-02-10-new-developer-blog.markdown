We just launched a new developer blog over at msnbc.com: Development @ msnbc. We are covering a bunch of different aspects about software development, from technical nitty-gritty on how we build and operate the software that runs our family of websites to philosophical perspectives on the softer side of development.

Head over there and check it out. We have several authors writing there, including John Bennett, Bryan Wheeler and Peter Durham (and yours truly).
