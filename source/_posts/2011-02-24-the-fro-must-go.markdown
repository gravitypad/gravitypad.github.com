From my friend Caleb:

As many of you know, my daughter is battling a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer. We’ve been fighting it for 2 years now, and continue to do so. One thing that’s become apparent is that there just hasn’t been enough money put into pediatric cancer research. St. Baldrick’s Foundation is a non-profit foundation that has donated more money to pediatric cancer research than anyone else (except for the government). To date, they’ve raised and granted more than $56 million. The remarkable thing is that they do this by getting people like me to shave their heads—and people like you to be of a generous spirit (you can see where this is going, can’t you?)

While “shaving events” happen year-round, the big events tend to be around St. Patrick’s Day. In Seattle, the event is at Fado Irish Pub, and is 2 weeks from today (march 10th). I just found out yesterday, and have decided to set an ambitious goal--$7500 in 2 weeks.  If you feel inspired to make a donation, please do so. As you can see from the photo on my page, my hair has become rather unruly, making the change to a shaved head more dramatic. As my wife has been saying, “the ‘fro must go!”, and what better way to get shorn?

Thanks!
Caleb
