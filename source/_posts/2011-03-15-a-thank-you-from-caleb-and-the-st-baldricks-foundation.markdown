Thank you all again for making my head-shaving event so incredibly successful. At the last minute, "Phoebe" donated $50, bringing our total to $11,500--exactly $4000 more than I had set as a goal! Imagine my surprise when I checked the site tonight and saw that another $250 had come in! And with the matching gifts that will trickle in, St. Baldrick's made more than $17,000 from my one silly haircut.

While I'm sorry to have missed the party at Fado's, I'm glad we did it at home: Phoebe had a ton of fun sitting on my lap and cutting off individual curls to put in a bag. The curls will go out to the fairy garden tomorrow so that the faries can use them for beds.

Thank you all again, and don't be too surprised if you hear from me again in a year...
