I just posted on our Development@msnbc blog some thoughts on Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote and it's applicability to software development.

> As to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.

> \- Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)
